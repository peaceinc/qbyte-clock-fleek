      <font color='black'>We have created a form of General Artificial Intelligence that is suitable for blockchain adaptation on the NEAR ecosystem and the decentralized application that we are submitting is one example of a potentially unlimited number of applications. Our raw data will serve as our core substrate (OCT) and our first substrate application is a desktop clock that tells UTC  time down to the millionth of a second and also displays the spatial nature of time ‘Spatial Relativity’. Like the ‘clock speed’ of a CPU, the timeline data we build on-chain will serve as a ‘clock speed’ for H.A.L.O. AI. The subsequent applications, of which we have already begun to develop several, will each have their own substrate.

      <font color='black'>The working technical name of the desktop application is : ‘Hybrid-Quantum Computing Spatial Relativity Time Dilation Clock with Non-deterministic Machine Learning Language Oracle (Q-Byte Clock) Our H.A.L.O. hardware combines elements of classical computing with quantum theory - electron tunneling  and creates a go-between platform that merges the worlds of superconducting computing with high performance desktop AI and gaming platforms.
